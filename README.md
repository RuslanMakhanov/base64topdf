# base64topdf

# Overview

## This repository contains Python scripts designed to convert Base64-encoded strings into PDF files.

# Scripts Description

## 1. First Script

**The first script processes a large CSV file, reading each line to extract the ID and corresponding Base64 code. It then references an Excel file to match the extracted ID with the appropriate PDF file name. Finally, it decodes the Base64 string and generates a PDF file with the matched name.**

## 2. Second Script

**The second script functions similarly to the first but includes additional logic. It checks for the existence of a second Base64 code within each CSV line. If present, it extracts this second code and references a different table within the same Excel document to find the corresponding PDF file name. The script then decodes and generates the PDF accordingly.**

### Background

***These scripts were developed in response to a critical issue encountered during my role as a Software Administrator, a position that typically did not involve coding responsibilities. An accidental deletion of all PDF files generated by one of our organization's services occurred, affecting documents from September 1st to December 31st.***

***Due to my previous experience as a Django Developer, the head of our department approached me for assistance. I was provided with four large CSV files—one for each affected month—which contained all necessary data, including the IDs and Base64-encoded strings.***

***Leveraging this data, I developed the logic described above to automate the restoration of the deleted PDF files. The individual responsible for the accidental deletion expressed their gratitude by treating me to two pizzas, acknowledging that without this script, they would have faced the daunting task of manually decoding and restoring each file.***

#Usage

**To use these scripts, ensure your CSV and Excel files are correctly formatted as described above. Execute the scripts in a Python environment with the necessary libraries installed.**
